Hi friends,

I am thrilled to announce that I have joined the [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) and [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io/) projects at [Protocol Labs](https://protocol.ai/) as a Technical Content Strategist - Technical Writer and Developer Advocate.

Protocol Labs is building the next generation of the internet - Web 3.0 and helping to advance all of humanity. For example, we are powering the Distributed Web and Web 3 with IPFS and decentralizing storage with Filecoin.

It is humbling for me to be a part of the team and community that is advancing the next phase of the internet.

Also excited to share that this week - October 15 - marks the ONE year anniversary of the Filecoin Mainnet Launch. You can join around the world in celebrating the [Filecoin orbits event](https://orbit.filecoin.io/) happening between October 18 - 22, 2021.

If you are in Warri Nigeria, join us for the Filecoin Orbit Nigeria event on Saturday, October 23, 2021, at Skynsense Hub, Effurun-Warri. [RSVP here](https://gdg.community.dev/events/details/google-gdg-warri-presents-filecoin-orbit-events-2021-warri/). And yes, there will be Jollof and swags. :)

And if you are in the blockchain ecosystem in Africa, please reach out. My DM is open on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/charliecodes), happy to connect and see how I can support your communities via meetups, workshops, and/or conferences around Web 3, the DWeb, IPFS, and Filecoin.

You can learn more about [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) and the [Protocol Labs](https://protocol.ai/). And if you want to dive deeper, check out the docs - [IPFS](https://docs.ipfs.io/) and [Filecoin](https://docs.filecoin.io/).
