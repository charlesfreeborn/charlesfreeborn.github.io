With blockchain, trust is established amongst unknown individuals. Blockchain was originally created to support cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.</p>\n<p>From a high level perspective, we can say that blockchain is a Decentralized Ledger Technology - DLT, comprising a triple-entry ledger. Blockchain contains debits, credits, and an immutable link to all past debits and credits.</p>\n<p>Most blockchain projects are built around -\na. Decentralization\nb. Scalability\nc. Security</p>\n<p>The three items listed above is what the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/charliecodes/status/1547211026160123906\">blockchain trilemma</a> is hinged on. The blockchain trilemma is a widely held belief that decentralized networks can only provide two of the three - decentralization, scalability, and security - benefits of blockchain at any given time.</p>\n<p>Establishing trust on the blockchain entails -</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Validation</li>\n<li>Verification</li>\n<li>Consensus</li>\n<li>Immutable recording</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In summary, blockchain technology supports methods for a decentralized peer-to-peer system, a collective trust model, and a distributed immutable ledger of transaction records.</p>\n<h2>Blockchain and decentralized systems</h2>\n<p>As a DLT, one of the benefits of the blockchain is the decentralized model. Blockchain operates in a trustless environment and with the decentralization model, there is no single point of failure.</p>\n<p>And herein lies the strength of blockchains.</p>\n<p>So we can say that a blockchain is just a database that is maintained by a network of users and secured via cryptography.</p>\n<p>In the decentralized model, every node - computer - on the blockchain is part of the network. You can think of a blockchain as a truly shared data infrastructure. New transactions are broadcast to and recorded by the network and every node will update their local copy of the blockchain.</p>\n<p>How then is trust implemented, if we say that blockchain operates in a trustless environment? Trust in a blockchain is implemented via algorithms and mechanisms like consensus. And this is possible, thanks to decentralization.</p>\n<p>Blockchain is about securing, validating, verifying, and making sure resources needed for transaction execution are available.</p>\n<p>To establish trust in a blockchain thus include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Securing chain using protocols</li>\n<li>Validating transactions and blocks for tampering</li>\n<li>Verifying availability of resources for transactions</li>\n<li>Executing and confirming transactions.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>The blockchain structure</h2>\n<p>A blockchain is a digital, append-only list of data records, and a type of distributed database. Records on a blockchain are called blocks, which are organized in a chronological order and are linked and secured using cryptography.</p>\n<p>A block consists of the header information about the block and a set of valid transactions.</p>\n<p>On the Bitcoin blockchain, transaction is the basic element. Transactions are validated and broadcast across the nodes on a blockchain. Many transactions form a block and these blocks are added to the blockchain through consensus.</p>\n<h2>Types of blockchains</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Public blockchain</li>\n<li>Private blockchain</li>\n<li>Hybrid or consortium blockchain</li>\n<li>Sidechains</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Basic oprations in a blockchain</h2>\n<p>The main operations in a blockchain are transaction validation and block creation with the consensus of the participants - miners.</p>\n<p>Two major roles for participants - miners in a blockchain -</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Participants that initiate a transfer of value by creating a transaction.</li>\n<li>Participants that work as miners who take on added work to verify transactions, broadcast transactions, compete to create a block, and reach consensus to validate the transactions. These participants are compensated with cryptocurrency like BTC.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Rules of blockchains</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>If a record has been created and recorded, it can’t be changed.</li>\n<li>Data written into a blockchain is a historical and immutable record.</li>\n<li>Data on the blockchain must be validated and proven that it has not been tampered.</li>\n<li>All nodes - computers - running on a blockchain must agree on all data stored in it. And that is consensus.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Algorithms and techniques in a blockchain</h2>\n<p>Consensus provides the technical infrastructure layer for blockchains. It does two things:\na. It ensures that the next block in a blockchain is the one and only version of truth.\nb. It keeps powerful adversaries from taking over the system.</p>\n<p>Consensus is the heart of blockchain. And an example of this consensus is Proof of Work and Proof of Stake.</p>\n<p>This leads to the two techniques for securing the blockchain - validation and verification - includes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Hashing</li>\n<li>Asymmetric key encryption</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Hashing</h3>\n<p>A hash function or hashing transforms and maps an arbitrary length of input data value to a fixed length value. The input data can be a document data of any length, tree data or block data.</p>\n<p>This implies that hashing is taking an input of any length and producing an output of a fixed length.</p>\n<p>The hashing requirements stipulate that an algorithm should be a one-way function and it should be collision-free.</p>\n<h3>Six properties to consider a hash as secured</h3>\n<p>These six properties can be used to consider that a cryptographic hash function is secured:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Deterministic</li>\n<li>Quick computation</li>\n<li>Pre-image resistance</li>\n<li>A small change in input changes the output</li>\n<li>Collision resistant</li>\n<li>Puzzle friendly.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Pros of blockchain</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Tokenization - You can create your own coins or tokens that have real-world value.</li>\n<li>Publicly verifiable transactions.</li>\n<li>Secured</li>\n<li>Lower transaction costs as a result of removing intermediaries.</li>\n<li>With smart contracts, we can achieve business process automation.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Cons of blockchain</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Blockchain is still a relatively new technology. So expect more evolution of the technology.</li>\n<li>Scalability needs to be addressed for blockchain to achieve mass adoption.</li>\n<li>Keeping data in blocks is still significantly high.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Blockchain use cases</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Background check - education credentails and criminal records.</li>\n<li>Secure document storage like home deeds, and will.</li>\n<li>Birth registries</li>\n<li>Land registries</li>\n<li>Tokenized economy</li>\n<li>Payment channels</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Summary/Conclusion</h2>\n<p>A blockchain is a globally shared, transactional database. This means everyone can read entries in the database by participating in the network or protocol.</p>\n<p>Blockchain is a state-based machine. It maintains a state until something happens. The mechanism for operating and determining the true state of the network is consensus.</p>\n<p>The blockchain is secured by a combination of decentralization, hashing, and encryption.</p>\n<p>You can think of a block as a group of data that’s packaged into one artifact. And we create an immutable link between blocks via cryptography.</p>\n<p>Changing data on any block will result in a different hash.</p>\n<p>Consensus mechanisms are the nuts and bolts of validation.</p>\n<p>In our next article, we will take a look at the Ethereum blockchain.</p>\n<p>And if you find this article interesting, kindly click here to share it.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"What is Blockchain?
